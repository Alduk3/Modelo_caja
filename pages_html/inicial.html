                <p>The BBJ designation denotes the business jets based upon the 737 series airliners. These aircraft usually seat between 25 and 50 passengers within a luxurious configuration. This may include a master bedroom, a washroom with showers, a conference/dining area, and a living area. Boeing Business Jets also has corporate jet configurations based on the 737 MAX, 777X, 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 Intercontinental, which are known as 737 MAX VIP, 777X VIP, 787 VIP, and 747-8 VIP, respectively.</p>

               Private: BBJs were initially operated by Fortune 100 companies like Aramco and Tracinda; NetJets, casinos like the Las Vegas Sands, but the 2008 recession put ultra large jets under scrutiny and were divested by many companies including The Limited, General Electric and Occidental Petroleum; or Chinese companies to avoid wealth displays. BBJ are now operated by private firms and individuals: Fresno's Assemi Group, Miami's Crescent Heights, Wichita's Town & Country Food Market, Funair Corp., toymaker Ty Inc., Fortress Transportation & Instructure, Jeffrey Katzenberg, John Travolta, Steven Spielberg, Washington Corp., Tutor Saliba or pachinko king Hideyuki Busujima, with many registrations hiding their owners’ identities.

                State VIP Users: Most BBJs are operated by governments for VIP transport in U.S., Australia and Africa, plus Colombia, Turkey and India, UAE, Jordan, Malaysia, South Africa or Tunisia; or Middle East oil barons like Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Saudi Arabia royalty.
